# About me

I specialize in developing analytical frameworks that bridge physics, machine learning, and biomedical research. 
My background in physics, where I developed mathematical models and computational tools to analyze complex systems, has shaped my problem-solving approach through a strong foundation in quantitative modeling.
As Co-Founder and Chief Data Scientist at CompuFlair LLC, a Houston-based data analysis consulting firm, I help organizations make informed decisions through expert consultation, experimental design, and advanced machine learning techniques. Our team specializes in analyzing complex biological and biomedical datasets, including genomics and neuroscience, with a passion for uncovering insights into brain function and disease mechanisms.
